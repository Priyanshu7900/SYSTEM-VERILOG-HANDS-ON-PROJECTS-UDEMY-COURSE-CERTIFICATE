#  Verification series part 2 system verilog Projects 

Successfully completed hands-on projects in SystemVerilog verification, gaining practical experience in verifying a wide range of designs. Learned to develop testbenches for digital building blocks such as D flip-flops and FIFOs, as well as communication protocols like SPI, UART, and I2C. Further worked  on complex bus protocols including APB, AHB, AXI, and Wishbone, ensuring correct protocol compliance and data handling. Applied object-oriented programming concepts, randomization, and reusable verification strategies to create scalable and efficient environments. This course strengthened my ability to verify both simple and advanced systems in a structured and industry-relevant manner.
